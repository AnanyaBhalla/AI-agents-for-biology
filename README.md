## üî¨ Overview

AI agents represent autonomous systems that perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals without constant human supervision. In biology, these agents are revolutionizing how we approach research, data analysis, and discovery.

### What Makes an AI Agent?

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Environmental Interaction**: Can perceive and interact with diverse environments (databases, lab equipment, code repositories)
- **Autonomy**: Operates independently with minimal human intervention
- **Memory**: Utilizes vector stores and RAG for contextual information storage and retrieval
- **Advanced Reasoning**: Powered by LLMs for strategic thinking and planning
- **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Combines perception, reasoning, and memory for goal-oriented decisions
